Trying to change the world since 1990

I'm a full stack polyglot programmer, in love with analytics and statistics. I also do behaviour psychology and read everything I can about marketing.

Started as a freelancer, worked for my University as a programmer and for my Faculty as a linux guy, built the first socially driven education platform in Romania ([GOmentorship](http://info.gomentorship.ro/)), then built an IT Programming Recruitment Platform that aggregated data from all over the place (StackOverflow, LinkedIn, Github, Smarterer) called [Softbinator](https://www.facebook.com/softbinator) that pivoted into the largest IT community in Bucharest / Romania that has over 2k active offline members.

After that moved to a B2B2C product - [Bookster](http://www.bookster.ro) that is the first and biggest private data-driven recommendation library in Romania with almost 20k paid subscribers that have borrowed and read over 300k books.

I'm also into hardware-driven software (drones and different hardware platforms - built the software for an awesome grinding rail for [Mountain Dew](https://goo.gl/hOC8xe)

Now I'm leading the tech team of the most innovative global short video content recommendation platform that curates amazing high-quality videos from all over the world and streams them to your smartphone, tablet or desktop computer - [Findie](https://fnd.ie/vid/VDnN)

I'm into making new professional acquaintances so **reach out** if you want to talk about bleeding edge technology.

Currently Focusing on: Graph Databases (Neo4j), React, React-Router, Reflux, Babel, Webpack, Hapi, Prediction.io, ElasticSearch, Compass, socket.io, MariaDB (TokuDB Engine), Redis, ffmpeg, caching, and horizontal-scaling.
